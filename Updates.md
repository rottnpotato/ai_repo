## [2023-11-15] - Code Analysis

### Components
- **SubscriptionService.ts**
  - Contains interfaces for `SubscriptionPlan`, `UserSubscription`, and `PurchaseSubscriptionRequest`
  - Already has a `PurchaseSubscription` method implemented for API calls to the subscription endpoint

- **Subscription Page (app/subscription/page.tsx)**
  - Comprehensive React component that handles:
    - Display of current subscription details
    - Listing available subscription plans
    - Handling payment methods
    - Managing subscription purchase flow
  - Includes dialogs for:
    - Adding payment methods
    - Changing subscription plans
    - Confirming subscription purchases

- **UseSubscription Hook (hooks/useSubscription.ts)**
  - Custom hook that provides functions for interacting with the SubscriptionService
  - Includes `PurchaseSubscription` function that calls the service method
  - Manages loading states and error handling

### Purchase Flow
1. User selects a subscription plan in the Change Plan dialog
2. User clicks "Proceed to Purchase" button, which calls `handleProceedToPurchase()`
3. Confirm Purchase dialog opens with plan details and payment options
4. User confirms purchase, which calls `handleConfirmPurchase()`
5. `handleConfirmPurchase()` calls the `PurchaseSubscription()` function from the UseSubscription hook
6. The hook calls the `PurchaseSubscription()` method in the SubscriptionService
7. On success, the dialog closes and a toast notification is shown
